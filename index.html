         For this project, I wanted to take the time to step back and truly observe some statistics of my life. I’m really fascinated with seeing how I approach my everyday life and seeing it layed out could potentially help me see my life from a different perspective. I couldn’t decide on what to focus on specifically, so I decided to capture every hour of my life for a week instead. It was definitely ambitious, but it made me realize how much of my life stays consistent among days. By choosing to focus on solely myself for this assignment, I took the liberties to emphasize that in my visualizers as well. For example, there is never any other person shown in the gifs, and if there is a person, they’re blacked out. This keeps the focus on me and what’s currently happening in my life. This project helped me be able to show off what I’m all about and what makes me unique as an individual. </p>

          P.S. You can randomize the time with 'Z', the day with 'X', and both with 'C'! You can also go back to the date select screen with 'BACKSPACE'.
